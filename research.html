            My research is in combinatorial and computational algebraic geometry.
            Recently, I have been looking at Hessenberg varieties, matrix Schubert varieties, and toric ideals of graphs using tools
            such as Frobenius splitting and geometric vertex decomposition.
            I enjoy experimenting in <i>Macaulay2</i>.

                        <b>Abstract.</b>
                        A regular nilpotent Hessenberg Schubert cell is the intersection of a regular nilpotent
                        Hessenberg variety with a Schubert cell.
                        In this paper, we describe a set of minimal generators of the defining ideal of a regular nilpotent
                        Hessenberg Schubert cell in the type <i>A</i> setting.
                        We show that these minimal generators are a Gröbner basis for an appropriate lexicographic
                        monomial order.
                        As a consequence, we obtain a new computational-algebraic proof, in type <i>A</i>, of
                        Tymoczko’s result that regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties are paved by affine spaces.
                        In addition, we prove that these defining ideals are complete intersections,
                        are geometrically vertex decomposable, and compute their Hilbert series.
                        We also produce a Frobenius splitting of each Schubert cell that compatibly splits all of the
                        regular nilpotent Hessenberg Schubert cells contained in it.
                        This work builds on, and extends, work of the second and third author on
                        defining ideals of intersections of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties with the (open)
                        Schubert cell associated to the Bruhat-longest permutation.

                        <b>Abstract.</b>
                        Geometric vertex decomposability for polynomial ideals is an ideal-theoretic generalization of
                        vertex decomposability for simplicial complexes.
                        Indeed, a homogeneous geometrically vertex decomposable ideal is radical and Cohen-Macaulay,
                        and is in the Gorenstein liaison class of a complete intersection (glicci).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this paper, we initiate an investigation into when the toric ideal <i>I<sub><small>G</small></sub></i> of a
                        finite simple graph G is geometrically vertex decomposable.
                        We first show how geometric vertex decomposability behaves under tensor products,
                        which allows us to restrict to connected graphs.
                        We then describe a graph operation that preserves geometric vertex decomposability,
                        thus allowing us to build many graphs whose corresponding toric ideals are geometrically vertex decomposable.
                        Using work of Constantinescu and Gorla, we prove that toric ideals of bipartite graphs are
                        geometrically vertex decomposable.
                        We also propose a conjecture that all toric ideals of graphs with a square-free degeneration
                        with respect to a lexicographic order are geometrically vertex decomposable.
                        As evidence, we prove the conjecture in the case that the universal Gröbner basis of
                        <i>I<sub><small>G</small></sub></i> is a set of quadratic binomials.
                        We also prove that some other families of graphs have the property that <i>I<sub><small>G</small></sub></i> is glicci.

                        We study Hessenberg varieties in type A via their local defining equations, called patch ideals.
                        We focus on two main classes of Hessenberg varieties: those associated to a regular nilpotent operator and those associated to a semisimple operator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the setting of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties, which are known to be smooth and irreducible,
                        we determine that their patch ideals are triangular complete intersections, as defined by Da Silva and Harada.
                        For semisimple Hessenberg varieties, we give a partial positive answer to a conjecture of Insko and Precup that
                        a given family of set-theoretic local defining ideals are radical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A regular nilpotent Hessenberg Schubert cell is the intersection of a Schubert cell with a regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety.
                        Following the work of the author with Da Silva, Harada, and Rajchgot, we construct an embedding of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg Schubert
                        cells into the coordinate chart of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety corresponding to the longest-word permutation in Bruhat order.
                        This allows us to use work of Da Silva and Harada to conclude that regular nilpotent Hessenberg Schubert cells are also
                        local triangular complete intersections.
